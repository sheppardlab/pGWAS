# pGWAS
### pGWAS and functional filtering pipeline to identify candidate adaptive genetic traits in bacteria

This repository contains scripts and methods accompanying the Méric, Mageiros et al. study “A pathogen in plain sight: disease-causing genotypes of the commensal skin bacterium Staphylococcus epidermidis” currently submitted for publication. This pGWAS method was developed by Leonardos Mageiros, Guillaume Méric and Samuel Sheppard at the University of Bath / Milner Centre for Evolution (United Kingdom), with considerable input from Koji Yahara (University of Tokyo, Japan), Xavier Didelot (Imperial College London).

This manual was written by Guillaume Méric, Leonardos Mageiros and Samuel K. Sheppard. All scripts for the method, as well as example input and output files, can be found in this repository. General inquiries, including technical, should be directed to s.k.sheppard@bath.ac.uk.
